A client that is designed to run on slower hardware.

When I created this client, it was because many others were packed with cosmetics, client side anticheats (CSA), and other annoying things 
that hindered the performance of the clients. I made XZIV Client so that people with lower levels of performance on older/slower hardware
could have the same experiences as people with godly pcs in Minecraft. Even Lunar Client was promised to be extremely good with fps, but I
found that they had all these things that people don't really need on singleplayer or servers like Hypixel. The BLC and Lunar CSA was really
laggy on my pc and all their "performance boosters" were actually making the client run slower. This is a much more barebones client and as
such there is less mods, but in my perspective that is a good thing. Thank you for coming to my TED talk, and thank you if you download this
client.
